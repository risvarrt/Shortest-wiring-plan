# Shortest-wiring-plan
we developed an application which can suggest shortest routes to lay the wiring from the power source to the interior of a building.

Due to the growing architecture and engineering, buildings have complex interiors nowadays. During the designing of the model of buildings like houses, apartments or schools the electrical wires should be laid and connected from the power source to each room in an optimum manner such that they reach the destination from the main in the shortest route as possible. This activity becomes tedious in case of a complex building.
So, we developed an application called shortest wiring plan which can suggest shortest routes to lay the wiring from the power source to the interior of a building.
The algorithm we used for solving this problem is Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. It can solve the shortest path problem from a given point to any point. The basic objective of the shortest wiring plan is to find the shortest path between a source and destination.
Our application inputs the source and destination (which are the names of the room inside the building) and outputs the shortest path between the source and destination. This would be useful for designing the electrical wiring route. The wiring path would be more efficient and simpler, so that even if there were any problems in the wiring, it would be an easier task to rectify.
We have considered only a model of a simple house for the application. In future we will improve our application so that it is useful for much bigger buildings such as apartments, schools, colleges etc.
